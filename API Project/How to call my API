This document provides instructions on how to call and access the Time API that returns the current time and UTC offset for specified capital cities.
My API address: 34.48.67.119

Step 1: Access the API
API URL:
The API is hosted on a public Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance, accessible via the following URL:
http://<YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP>:5050/time?city=<CITY_NAME>
Replace <YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP> with the public IP address of the GCP instance and <CITY_NAME> with one of the supported cities (e.g., Brasilia).
The API currently supports the following cities: Washington, Brasilia

Step 2: Add the Token for Authorization
The required token is: mysecrettoken
How to Add the Token:
Using cURL:
Open a terminal and run the following command:curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken" "http://<YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP>:5050/time?city=Brasilia"

Step 3: Expected API Response
Successful Response:
{
    "city": "Brasilia",
    "current_time": "2025-05-13 13:15:30",
    "utc_offset": "UTC-03:00"
}
This response provides the current local time and UTC offset for the requested city.

Error Responses:
City Not Found (404 Not Found):
{
    "error": "City 'London' not found in database."
}
Unauthorized Access (401 Unauthorized):
{
    "error": "Unauthorized access. Invalid or missing token."
}

Step 4: How to Test the API
Locally (on your GCP instance):
Open your browser or terminal and navigate to:
http://<YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP>:5050/time?city=Brasilia
Ensure that the Authorization header is correctly set to the token.

If You Can't Access the API:
Ensure the GCP firewall allows traffic on port 5050.
Check that the Flask application is running properly by checking your terminal for errors.
